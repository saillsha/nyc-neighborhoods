building floor plan for the Free People BUFFALO, NY Walden Galleria location is marked up with one distinct zone. Nomi recommends a one-sensor installation to cover the proposed zone plus one camera door counter. This includes one wired sensor for zone 1. The proposed installation indicates that the wired sensor be installed in a convenient location at the cash wrap, as indicated in Diagram 1. In the event that there is not an available pre-wired Ethernet drop at the cash wrap to the network rack/closet, a single gateway sensor has been included that will be the hard-wired sensor, allowing the zone sensor to mesh with the gateway sensor.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe camera door counter is to be installed in a convenient location at least 9 ft above the entrance doors in the open ceiling, as indicated in Diagram 1. The camera will be adjusted via the camera interface after installation, so the exact location of the camera over the door is not critical. A single Ethernet cable pull will be required from the network rack to the camera location.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;page-break\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;All equipment is shipped to location with each device preconfigured and clearly labeled. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;h3&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Scope of Work/Schedule&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/h3&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nInstall and configure Nomi sensors and cameras.

Nomi recommends a one-sensor installation to cover the proposed zone plus one camera door counter. This includes one wired sensor for zone 1. The proposed installation indicates that the wired sensor be installed in a convenient location at the cash wrap, as indicated in Diagram 1. In the event that there is not an available pre-wired Ethernet drop at the cash wrap to the network rack/closet, a single gateway sensor has been included that will be the hard-wired sensor, allowing the zone sensor to mesh with the gateway sensor.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe camera door counter is to be installed in a convenient location at least 9 ft above the entrance doors in the open ceiling, as indicated in Diagram 1. The camera will be adjusted via the camera interface after installation, so the exact location of the camera over the door is not critical. A single Ethernet cable pull will be required from the network rack to the camera location.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;page-break\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;All equipment is shipped to location with each device preconfigured and clearly labeled. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;h3&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Scope of Work/Schedule&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/h3&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nInstall and configure Nomi sensors and cameras.

Nomi recommends a one-sensor installation to cover the proposed zone plus one camera door counter. This includes one wired sensor for zone 1. The proposed installation indicates that the wired sensor be installed in a convenient location at the cash wrap, as indicated in Diagram 1. In the event that there is not an available pre-wired Ethernet drop at the cash wrap to the network rack/closet, a single gateway sensor has been included that will be the hard-wired sensor, allowing the zone sensor to mesh with the gateway sensor.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe camera door counter is to be installed in a convenient location at least 9 ft above the entrance doors in the open ceiling, as indicated in Diagram 1. The camera will be adjusted via the camera interface after installation, so the exact location of the camera over the door is not critical. A single Ethernet cable pull will be required from the network rack to the camera location.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;page-break\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;All equipment is shipped to location with each device preconfigured and clearly labeled. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;h3&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Scope of Work/Schedule&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/h3&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nInstall and configure Nomi sensors and cameras.

Otherwise, the pre-wired Ethernet drop connected to the single-port PoE injector at the network rack will be patched into the “12-24v Poe” port on the sensor. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;b&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;For support for this, contact Spencer Support. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/b&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAfter each sensor is installed, connectivity is verified when the LED indicator light blinks green.

Nomi recommends a one-sensor installation to cover the proposed zone plus one camera door counter. This includes one wired sensor for zone 1. The proposed installation indicates that the wired sensor be installed in a convenient location at the cash wrap, as indicated in Diagram 1. In the event that there is not an available pre-wired Ethernet drop at the cash wrap to the network rack/closet, a single gateway sensor has been included that will be the hard-wired sensor, allowing the zone sensor to mesh with the gateway sensor.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe camera door counter is to be installed in a convenient location at least 9 ft above the entrance doors in the open ceiling, as indicated in Diagram 1. The camera will be adjusted via the camera interface after installation, so the exact location of the camera over the door is not critical. A single Ethernet cable pull will be required from the network rack to the camera location.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;page-break\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;All equipment is shipped to location with each device preconfigured and clearly labeled. &amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;h3&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Scope of Work/Schedule&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/h3&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nInstall and configure Nomi sensors and cameras.

Nomi recommends a one-sensor installation to cover the proposed zone plus one camera door counter. This includes one wired sensor for zone 1. The proposed installation indicates that the wired sensor be installed in a convenient location at the cash wrap, as indicated in Diagram 1. In the event that there is not an available pre-wired Ethernet drop at the cash wrap to the network rack/closet, a single gateway sensor has been included that will be the hard-wired sensor, allowing the zone sensor to mesh with the gateway sensor.\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\nThe camera door counter is to be installed in a convenient location at least 9 ft above the entrance doors in the open ceiling, as indicated in Diagram 1. The camera will be adjusted via the camera interface after installation, so the exact location of the camera over the door is not critical. A single Ethernet cable pull will be required from the network rack to the camera location.\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;lt;p class=\\\\\\\\&amp;amp;amp;quot;page-break\\\\\\\\&amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;gt;All equipment is shipped to location with each device preconfigured and clearly labeled. &amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;lt;h3&amp;amp;amp;gt;Scope of Work/Schedule&amp;amp;amp;lt;/h3&amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\n&amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;gt;\\\\\\\\nInstall and configure Nomi sensors and cameras.

Nomi recommends a one-sensor installation to cover the proposed zone plus one camera door counter. This includes one wired sensor for zone 1. The proposed installation indicates that the wired sensor be installed in a convenient location at the cash wrap, as indicated in Diagram 1. In the event that there is not an available pre-wired Ethernet drop at the cash wrap to the network rack/closet, a single gateway sensor has been included that will be the hard-wired sensor, allowing the zone sensor to mesh with the gateway sensor.\\n&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\\nThe camera door counter is to be installed in a convenient location at least 9 ft above the entrance doors in the open ceiling, as indicated in Diagram 1. The camera will be adjusted via the camera interface after installation, so the exact location of the camera over the door is not critical. A single Ethernet cable pull will be required from the network rack to the camera location.\\n&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\\n&amp;lt;p class=\\&amp;quot;page-break\\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;All equipment is shipped to location with each device preconfigured and clearly labeled. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\\n&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Scope of Work/Schedule&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;\\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\\nInstall and configure Nomi sensors and cameras.

A Sensor Power Adapter will be connected to the PoE injector and plugged into a power outlet, preferably a UPS. Otherwise, existing power will be utilized at the cash wrap and the PoE injector will be returned to Nomi after the installation is complete. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;For support for this, contact Spencer Support&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Camera Installation&lt;/b&gt; - When unpacking the camera, DO NOT destroy the box. This box has a prepaid shipping label attached and will be used to return extra equipment to Nomi if it is unused. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nEntrance 1 camera is installed on the ceiling on the centerline perpendicular to the entrance door approximately 3 ft into the store from the entrance door. For detailed instructions on how the camera is mounted, please refer to &lt;span class=\&quot;underline\&quot;&gt;Hardware Installation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe camera angle is pointed down and zoomed to include only the area directly in front of the door and a small amount of the doorway borders or frames on each side as shown in the red rectangle in Diagram 1. For further instruction on how to point and zoom the camera view, please refer to Axis User Manual - Axis M3204 at: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\&quot;http://www.axis.com/files/manuals/um_m3204_45313_en_1112.pdf\&quot;&gt;http://www.axis.com/files/manuals/um_m3204_45313_en_1112.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nIn order to view the camera for aiming, you must connect the camera to your laptop. To do this:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\nConnect a single Ethernet cable from the camera’s Ethernet port to the “Data + Power Out” port on the Camera PoE Injector, designated by , and then another Ethernet cable from the Camera PoE Injector’s “Data In” port to the laptop’s Ethernet port. Power up the Camera PoE Injector.\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\nEnsure that your laptop’s wifi is disabled/turned off, that you are not Bluetooth tethered to your cell phone or any other device, and that you do not have a static IP address set on your Ethernet LAN adapter interface.\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\nLaunch the IP Utility. When the utility runs, it will find the camera and display the Name, IP Address, and Serial Number in the Utility’s table. Double- click the IP address in the table and it will launch your browser and connect you to the camera.\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\nYou should be prompted for a username and password, which are “root” and “password” respectively, without the quotation marks.\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\nOnce logged into the camera, if you do not see video, you may see a yellow bar across the top of your browser window that will ask you to install an ActiveX control. You MUST install this control in order to see the video.\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\nWhen you see the video, make the necessary adjustments to aim the camera as needed and focus the camera to the floor.\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\nOnce aimed, zoomed, and focused, tighten all the adjustment lockdown screws so that the aiming doesn’t change, and verify that it is still aimed correctly.\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\nDisconnect the temporary cable from the camera and connect the Ethernet drop from the network switch.\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\nAdjust the black plastic shield inside the camera cover so that the opening will let the lens of the camera see through it, and attach the cover to the camera with the supplied screws &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;For support for this, contact Spencer Support&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nOnce the camera is installed, please contact the Nomi Support Center to verify that the camera is aimed correctly and indicate to Nomi that the trip wire configuration is ready to be performed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;For support for this, contact Nomi Support&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;b class=\&quot;inline\&quot;&gt;Camera Network and Power&lt;/b&gt; - PoE must be run from the network rack to the camera location above designated by in Diagram 1. If a PoE switch port is NOT present at the network rack, the camera PoE injector, designated by , will be installed at the network rack on the Ethernet line designated for the camera using a short (3 ft or less) Ethernet patch cable, which is required and to be supplied by Spencer. Otherwise, a PoE switch port will be used to supply network and PoE to the camera and the supplied PoE injector will be returned to Nomi after the installation is complete.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;For support for this, contact Spencer Support&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\nGateway Installation – In the event that there is not a pre-wired Ethernet drop located at the cash wrap, the gateway sensor, designated by in Diagram 1, will be mounted on the top of the network rack and plugged into an available network port defined above. The sensor should be mounted securely to the rack using a zip tie or screws in the rack attached to the mounting points on the back of the sensor. Power for the gateway sensor will be supplied by the included power adapter, which should be connected to power supplying the network rack, preferably a UPS. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;For support for this, contact Spencer Support.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nIf a pre-wired Ethernet drop exists between the cash wrap and the network rack the gateway sensor will NOT be used and will be returned to Nomi after the installation is complete. Skip to step 7. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAfter the gateway sensor is installed, connectivity is verified when the LAN LED light is a solid blue and the LED indicator light blinks green. For more LED indicator light definitions, please refer to “What do the lights on the OM2P mean” in the FAQ/Troubleshooting section, above.\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\nSensor Installation - The sensors are pre-configured and specifically labeled for their intended zones. Care must be taken to install the sensors in the appropriate zones. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe sensor for Zone 1, designated by in Diagram 1, is installed inside the cash wrap in a convenient location that is both accessible yet not easily disturbed by day-to-day store operations. If there is no pre-wired Ethernet drop between the cash wrap and the network rack, the power supply will be plugged directly into a power outlet – preferably a UPS – at the cash wrap and connected to the sensor. Otherwise, the pre-wired Ethernet drop connected to the single-port PoE injector at the network rack will be patched into the “12-24v Poe” port on the sensor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;For support for this, contact Spencer Support. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAfter each sensor is installed, connectivity is verified when the LED indicator light blinks green. For more LED indicator light definitions, please refer to &lt;b&gt;“What do the lights on the OM2P mean”&lt;/b&gt; in the FAQ/Troubleshooting section, above. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;For support for this, contact Nomi Support. &lt;/b&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Post-Installation&lt;/b&gt; - After the installation is complete, if any hardware was not used as indicated in the installation steps above, it is to be returned to Nomi.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
The building floor plan for the Free People BUFFALO, NY Walden Galleria location is marked up with one distinct zone. Nomi recommends a one-sensor installation to cover the proposed zone plus one camera door counter. This includes one wired sensor for zone 1.

In order to view the camera for aiming, you must connect the camera to your laptop. To do this:
<ul>
<li>
Connect a single Ethernet cable from the camera’s Ethernet port to the “Data + Power Out” port on the Camera PoE Injector, designated by , and then another Ethernet cable from the Camera PoE Injector’s “Data In” port to the laptop’s Ethernet port. Power up the Camera PoE Injector.
</li>
<li>
Ensure that your laptop’s wifi is disabled/turned off, that you are not Bluetooth tethered to your cell phone or any other device, and that you do not have a static IP address set on your Ethernet LAN adapter interface.
</li>
<li>
Launch the IP Utility. When the utility runs, it will find the camera and display the Name, IP Address, and Serial Number in the Utility’s table. Double- click the IP address in the table and it will launch your browser and connect you to the camera.
</li>
<li>
You should be prompted for a username and password, which are “root” and “password” respectively, without the quotation marks.
</li>
<li>
Once logged into the camera, if you do not see video, you may see a yellow bar across the top of your browser window that will ask you to install an ActiveX control. You MUST install this control in order to see the video.
</li>
<li>
When you see the video, make the necessary adjustments to aim the camera as needed and focus the camera to the floor.
</li>
<li>
Once aimed, zoomed, and focused, tighten all the adjustment lockdown screws so that the aiming doesn’t change, and verify that it is still aimed correctly.
</li>
<li>
Disconnect the temporary cable from the camera and connect the Ethernet drop from the network switch.
</li>
</ul>
Adjust the black plastic shield inside the camera cover so that the opening will let the lens of the camera see through it, and attach the cover to the camera with the supplied screws <br><br>
<b>For support for this, contact Spencer Support</b><br><br>
Once the camera is installed, please contact the Nomi Support Center to verify that the camera is aimed correctly and indicate to Nomi that the trip wire configuration is ready to be performed. <br><br>
<b>For support for this, contact Nomi Support</b><br>
</li>
<li>
<b class="inline">Camera Network and Power</b> - PoE must be run from the network rack to the camera location above designated by in Diagram 1. If a PoE switch port is NOT present at the network rack, the camera PoE injector, designated by , will be installed at the network rack on the Ethernet line designated for the camera using a short (3 ft or less) Ethernet patch cable, which is required and to be supplied by Spencer. Otherwise, a PoE switch port will be used to supply network and PoE to the camera and the supplied PoE injector will be returned to Nomi after the installation is complete.<br><br>
<b>For support for this, contact Spencer Support</b><br>
</li>
<li>
Gateway Installation – In the event that there is not a pre-wired Ethernet drop located at the cash wrap, the gateway sensor, designated by in Diagram 1, will be mounted on the top of the network rack and plugged into an available network port defined above. The sensor should be mounted securely to the rack using a zip tie or screws in the rack attached to the mounting points on the back of the sensor. Power for the gateway sensor will be supplied by the included power adapter, which should be connected to power supplying the network rack, preferably a UPS. <br><br>
<b>For support for this, contact Spencer Support.</b><br><br>
If a pre-wired Ethernet drop exists between the cash wrap and the network rack the gateway sensor will NOT be used and will be returned to Nomi after the installation is complete. Skip to step 7. <br><br>
After the gateway sensor is installed, connectivity is verified when the LAN LED light is a solid blue and the LED indicator light blinks green. For more LED indicator light definitions, please refer to “What do the lights on the OM2P mean” in the FAQ/Troubleshooting section, above.
</li>
<li>
Sensor Installation - The sensors are pre-configured and specifically labeled for their intended zones. Care must be taken to install the sensors in the appropriate zones. <br><br>
The sensor for Zone 1, designated by in Diagram 1, is installed inside the cash wrap in a convenient location that is both accessible yet not easily disturbed by day-to-day store operations. If there is no pre-wired Ethernet drop between the cash wrap and the network rack, the power supply will be plugged directly into a power outlet – preferably a UPS – at the cash wrap and connected to the sensor. Otherwise, the pre-wired Ethernet drop connected to the single-port PoE injector at the network rack will be patched into the “12-24v Poe” port on the sensor. <br><br>
<b>For support for this, contact Spencer Support. </b><br><br>
After each sensor is installed, connectivity is verified when the LED indicator light blinks green. For more LED indicator light definitions, please refer to <b>“What do the lights on the OM2P mean”</b> in the FAQ/Troubleshooting section, above. <br><br>
<b>For support for this, contact Nomi Support. </b>
</li>
<li>
<b>Post-Installation</b> - After the installation is complete, if any hardware was not used as indicated in the installation steps above, it is to be returned to Nomi. Use the camera box and the leftover packing materials from the box to pack up the remaining equipment to return to Nomi, and use the included prepaid shipping label that is already attached to the camera box. Please be sure to seal up the box with packing tape, and give it to the store manager to have it picked up by FedEx. <br><br>
Additionally, verify that the camera is still aimed/focused/zoomed correctly by connecting your laptop to the network switch, running the IPUtility again to locate the camera and obtain the IP address, double-click the IP address in the IPUtility, and ensure that the camera Field Of View has not changed from your original setting. <br><br>
Take photos of the installation and be certain to include: <br><br>
<ul>
<li>Photos of each Gateway Sensor, if used; all zone Sensors, camera, camera and doorway (if possible), and the network switch where equipment is connected.</li>
<li> Photos of anything that is listed in the “Installation Changes” section should they be needed for clarification</li>
</ul>
Scan (preferably) or take a photo of Diagram 1 from above to pass along any device location changes that were determined on site. <br><br>
Send all photos and scanned images to <a href="mailto:installations@getnomi.com?" target="_top">installations@getnomi.com</a>within 24 hours of the end of installation.
